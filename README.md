A simple socket.io demo

by Jennifer Piper

Based on demo by Vinicio Sanchez in Code Fellows Code401 class, 6/14/2018

Notes:
To use socket.io, you have to build a normal http server (with express, in this case) and a socket.io server


Frontend:

 npm i dotenv express uuid socket.io  (not sockeio, that's a different package)
